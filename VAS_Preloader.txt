The Virtual Ammobox System Preloader (VASP) is a simple mission / utility for those that are having long load times while using addons such as ACRE. All you need to do is drag the
VAS_Preloader.Stratis.pbo to either your missions directory or MPMissions directory and whenever you are fixing to get into a large Co-Op mission or whatever with ACRE/Other large 
addons just play the VAS_Preloader mission first and let it preload information for VAS, once it's completed you will have a hint and you're ready to go. Long load times should
no longer be a problem.

It is a simplistic concept and it's the best work-around that I can provide.
